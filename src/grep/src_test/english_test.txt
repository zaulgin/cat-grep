You can extract the files from the Skins folder and run them on your own installation.
This installation of Zandronum 3.0 alpha that I included has everything configured for optimal performance.

If you are going to move it to your own installation, remember to disable the Enhanced Night Vision Mode.
This instalation is configured for a 1600x900 default resolution, on windowed mode.
You can change it to fullscreen and change it to other resolutions by going



to options > set video mode.
You can run either bd64v1_main with other map packs or vanilla Doom maps, or bd64v1_maps alone to play these maps
with custom gameplay mods.

You can control the amount of blood and gore by opening the console and typing bd_bloodamount * (* is a number from 1 to 4)
You can enable the "janitor" to make blood and gore disappear after some time by typing in the console bd_lowgraphicsmode 1 (type
bd_lowgraphicsmode 0 to disable)
